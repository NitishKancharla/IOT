# IoT-Enabled Solar Grid Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a smart grid using Arduino and Cool term, focusing on the power generated by combined solar panels under different weather conditions. The Arduino measures voltage and current using sensors, calculates power, and displays the results on an LCD. Four LEDs indicate power conditions (white for on, red for high power, green for low power, yellow for normal). The cool term software is used for storage and analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board
- Two solar panels
- Voltage sensor
- Current sensor
- I2C LCD display
- Four LEDs (white, red, green, yellow)
- 1k resistors
- Jumpers
- CoolTerm software

Connect the solar panels, sensors, LEDs, and LCD display to the Arduino board as described in the Block Diagram section of the PDF file. Upload the code provided in the Code section to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. Open CoolTerm software to access the Arduino's serial port and record real-time data.

## Tests and Calibration

Conduct thorough tests under different conditions to evaluate the performance of the system. Calibrate sensors and adjust the thresholds of LED indicators to accurately represent energy levels.

## Results

The system continuously measures the voltage and current of the combined solar panels, enabling real-time energy production calculations. LED indicators provide user-friendly visual representations of power conditions and facilitate rapid assessment. The data logging takes place by using cool term software. The analysis of the collected data revealed insights into the system performance under different conditions. The fluctuations in power output are correlated with changes in sun intensity throughout the day.
